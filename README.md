Conundrum (Amgine)
=========

Project Conundrum or Amgine is an iOS mobile application that utilizes Enigma API. Members include Huy Le and Winston Chen. When we used Enigma at app.enigma.io to check out their dataset, we observed a website with loads of information packed in their website. For our entry at Hacking Journalism, we decided to provide a more everyday user formate for that information from datasets provided by Enigma. Also, we wanted to create a mobile platform, which would be used by the everyday person.

Through Enigma API and d3.js, we designed Amgine (Project Conundrum), which provides maneuvering through sources and topics from Enigma. One can bookmark any dataset, and see interesting visualizations in the form of bars and graphs.
